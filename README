This project is for building an AJAX application that could help user have some hint on the
input texts.

Coding styles commited:
1. tend to be using space rather than tabs
2. tend to use 2-space wide for each indent
3. the naming rules seems to be fine right now
4. no tracing spaces
5. using unix style line returns
6. use braces like:
   if (foo is true) {
     do something...
   } else {
     do the opposite...
   }
