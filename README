This project is for building an AJAX application that could help user have some hint on the
input texts.

Learning notes:
1. Javascript:
	a. Chrome and firefox can help us debug, it is really useful and beautiful.
	   You can set breakpoints, step trace, step into the function and debug
	b. Now I use console.log console.err(..), console.warn("...") more often.
	   Because alert(..) is a little bit annoying.
	c. The next goal is to get/set the node of the DOM to whatever I want.
2. 


Coding styles commited:
1. tend to be using space rather than tabs
2. tend to use 2-space wide for each indent
3. the naming rules seems to be fine right now
4. no tracing spaces
5. using unix style line returns
6. use braces like:
   if (foo is true) {
     do something...
   } else {
     do the opposite...
   }
